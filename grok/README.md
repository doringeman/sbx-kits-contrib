# grok

A standalone agent kit (`kind: agent`) for [Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build)
(`grok`), xAI's terminal-based coding agent. The kit installs Grok Build into
the sandbox at creation time, wires its API auth through the sandbox proxy,
and runs `grok --yolo --no-auto-update` as the entrypoint when you attach.

## Prerequisites

- An [xAI](https://console.x.ai) account and API key.
- `$XAI_API_KEY` exported on your host. The sandbox proxy manages it — the
  key itself never enters the sandbox.

## Usage

Run the kit. Pass the kit's name (`grok`) as the agent argument:

```console
$ sbx run --kit "git+https://github.com/docker/sbx-kits-contrib.git#dir=grok" grok
```

Or with a local clone of this repo:

```console
$ sbx run --kit ./grok/ grok
```

The first launch installs Grok Build via its official install script.
Subsequent launches reuse the sandbox.

## How auth works

`network.serviceDomains` maps `api.x.ai` (the xAI chat-completions API) to
the `xai` service, and `network.serviceAuth.xai` tells the proxy to inject
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` on outbound requests to that host. The key
comes from `XAI_API_KEY`, sourced via `credentials.sources.xai.env` and
marked `environment.proxyManaged` so it's substituted by the proxy rather
than baked into the container.

`grok`'s browser-based OAuth login (`grok login`, the interactive default)
isn't wired up by this kit — there's no browser inside the sandbox to
complete it. Setting `XAI_API_KEY` sidesteps that entirely: per Grok's own
[auth precedence](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/main/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/02-authentication.md#auth-precedence),
the API key is used whenever no session token is already active, which is
always true for a fresh sandbox.

## How the install works

Grok Build's installer (`x.ai/cli/install.sh`) only symlinks `grok` onto an
existing, writable `PATH` directory — either `~/.local/bin` or
`/usr/local/bin` — it never creates one. `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH` already
via the `shell-docker` base image, but the image never creates the
directory itself, so on a fresh container the installer would silently fall
back to appending `~/.bashrc`, which a non-interactive kit entrypoint never
sources. `commands.install` works around this by `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin`
before running the installer, so `grok` is on `PATH` immediately.

## Customization

Grok Build reads project rules from `AGENTS.md` (also `CLAUDE.md` and a few
other filenames, for compatibility with other agents' conventions — see
[Project Rules](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/main/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/12-project-rules.md)).
